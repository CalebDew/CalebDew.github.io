                <h1>What is the purpose of the BYU education</h1>
                <p>According to the class:</p>
                <ul style="width: 50%;">
                    <li>"the focus in learning is not to become the best of all. We are learning so we can go out and
                        serve.
                        We are learning to we can go out and learn. I sometimes think down the roads I could go and
                        realize,
                        what would be the point of getting a hire level job and making money? Well, there really is no
                        reason to make money if you're not gonna spend it. What I mean by that is we are to make money
                        to
                        contribute to society, whether that's be circulating it back into the economy or helping out
                        your
                        kids, or giving to charities, or using it to learning new things."</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>"At college, we're not just learning the things we need to pass, we should be learning how to
                        think
                        about important things. And that involves the study of things we might not find worthwhile at
                        first
                        glance. A broad education will teach us to be better at thinking broadly."</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>"I love that BYU encourages that and helps us come closer to God as well as strengthen our
                        testimonies. It's a blessing that we are able to learn and expand our knowledge in a setting
                        that
                        supports us as we strive to develop a relationship with God."</li>

        <div class="whyByu">
            <div class="text">

                <p>According to the class:</p>
                <ul style="width: 50%;">
                    <li>To be an academic anablep in Dr. Brinton's context means to see and understand things from not
                        only an academic point of view but also a religious point of view. While working as a speech
                        language pathologist, Dr. Brinton learned to use her beliefs and values in a way to influence
                        her patients' lives for the better. Not only was she able to do this through her vast knowledge
                        as a speech pathologist, but she was also able to use spiritual insight to frame her work. In
                        one of her examples, she worked with a child who had very limited language development by giving
                        him a journal. This approach allowed him to connect with his family, recognize his self-worth
                        and greatly enhance his ability to communicate. Overall, her work with this child was
                        unconventional and it didn't simply just help him with his language development. Similarly,
                        studying at BYU doesn't simply just give me an education. It gives me an eternal, celestial
                        perspective on the world. It gives meaning to my studies, and ties in what I believe as a
                        disciple of Christ to my career.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>To be an academic anablep is to be able to see both sides of an issue, both through a spiritual
                        and a traditional framework. I love this example that was given because it showed how seeing
                        both frameworks and creating a synthetic blend of both led to the best results for the child. I
                        think BYU uniquely can help us to develop this type of outlook on the world through presenting
                        scholarly information with a spiritual overlay. I feel like my experience at BYU so far has
                        helped me to learn by study and by faith, which helps me to see both sides of an issue and make
                        decisions on the best way to approach it.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>I think that being an academic anablep is a great analogy having your eyes set on goals above
                        and below the water. Being able to see the world through a celestial and spiritual view and
                        understand how that ties into the secular world will help accomplish your goals and plans with
                        more ease. I think that BYU is the best way to get the anablep perspective. We are taught
                        subjects and fields that everyone has the opportunity to learn but we also know how to rely on
                        God and have Him in our lives. Because of the view BYU gives me I know that I can learn and
                        continue progressing outside of college and outside of this earthly life. I am able to worry
                        less because I have an eternal perspective and I understand that what happens here on earth is
                        not the end.</li>
